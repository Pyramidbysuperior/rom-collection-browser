Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.s
Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.

The two players take sides in an split-screen air battle above France in 1916. Player one starts off as an English pilot on the left side, and player two flies his red Luftwaffe plane from the strip on the right screen. At the end of each strip is a tree, so lift-off requires precision; too early and you will stall to the ground; too late, and you will crash into a tree.

As the two players fly towards each other, the split screen is joint as they reach visual contact, and likewise split off again if they fly away from each other. If a player is shot down, he must take off again from his base, and the winner gains a point. In the time it takes for the other player to lift off, you are at liberty to fly to his base and bomb both him and his hangar. Beware, though, for there is an AA emplacement at the base. The anti air artillery alternates between slow-moving shots and explosive flak, the latter being much more difficult to avoid. If you manage to bomb the artillery, the opposing player is more or less at your mercy  at least until the artillery is regenerated or if he manages to avoid your bombs and shots to shoot you down.

To spice things up, both sides have zeppelins which enter the game from time to time. The zeppelins are big targets but fire at you with great accuracy. In the middle of the playfield is a lake, where German and English U-boats take turns. They can be bombed, but have the same firepower as the AA batteries.

Control of your plane is imperative. Climbing too fast will put you into a stall, while steep dives will speed up your plane. Flying too high will also result in a stall, though this option can be turned off. If you manage to fly straight at the very top of the screen, you can take a shortcut above the mountain at the back of each air field. This will wrap you around to the opposing end of the screen.

Written in AMOS, Dogfight will let the players go on as long as they want, so the winner is usually he who first reaches a score set according to a gentlemans agreement.

Wow. This game made me want to smash my face through my SNES system repeatedly. Youre this little dude and you do stereotypical California games.

Graphics 2/10

Its nothing special. Theres some flat, uninteresting colors that help you tell one thing from another, but for the most part, the graphics arent anything extraordinary. They dont hurt the game, but a hardcore graphics lover wouldnt be pleased.

Gameplay 1/10

Not fun at all. Like I said, you run around California doing some boring games. You can go hang-gliding, but all you do is fly out, pick up a few things and drift back to land. You could be done within 30 seconds. Then you can Jet-Ski, where you ride around a surprisingly complex track. However, theres no racing, just some obstacles. Then, somehow quickly getting from the ocean to the mountains, you go snowboarding. You ride down the hill and at one point hit a half pipe and do a trick or two while struggling to get out. Then you continue on and you get to a point without snow, which makes no sense to me. Then, you get to go skating in yet another long and winding track. And did I mention the ''commentary'' throughout all the events? Yeah. Theres some ''dude'' who never talks, but little words appear above him. He spouts words like ''bogus'' or ''face plant'' if you do poorly. If you do well, hell say something like ''totally'' or ''awesome''. 

Before every event, hell say something like ''get ready to carve concrete'' or some other witty line. They all have do to with cutting for some reason, however.

Controls 2/10

Really awkward at some points but better at others. Itd be so much better if you didnt have to share a single controller for multiplayer.

Sound: 1/10

The music drives me nuts. Its a little, repeating ''guitar'' piece and then it keeps going...and going...and going until you turn the game off. Youd be happier with the sound down or off.

Buy or Rent?

If you have to do one of those, rent it. Otherwise stay the ### away from this game. You could pick it up in a bargain bin just for a laugh, but dont spend too much on this game, as youll be sick of it in a few days.

Overall

I despised this game with all of my heart when I was younger. Now I can pop it in for a quick laugh, but the humor soon fades.

INSERT INTO Game (id, name, description, gameCmd, alternateGameCmd, romCollectionId, publisherId, developerId, reviewerId, yearId, maxPlayers, rating, numVotes, url, region, media, perspective, controllerType, isFavorite, launchCount) VALUES (9, 'Demolition Man', 'Demolition Man is a multiplatform, run and gun action game based on the film of the same name. The player controls the main character, John Spartan as he attempts to find and defeat his arch-nemesis, Simon Phoenix. Even though he is the final boss of the game, the player has to fight him in teaser battles before defeating him for good at the cryo-prison.

Two different views are used within the game. Some stages are platform game type in side view, and include jumping and climbing, while other stages take an overhead top-down shooter view; in all stages the player character can fire in eight directions. Stages are filled with many enemies, mostly gunmen. Enemy characters and the player character can take a number of hits before dying. Power ups can be found around the stages that increase the characters health or ammunition. The game gives the player limited continues and very few lives. The first stage is set in 1996 and all stages after in 2032, following a simplified plot of the movie. In the two overhead view stages the player must find and rescue hostages in order to unlock further into the level.

Weapons include the basic pistol, the basic rifle, rapid-fire machine gun, grenades, among others. Losing a life can occur through being shot to death, being crushed to death, being thrown off the train, accidentally getting frozen by Simon Phoenixs cryogenic gun, and falling into a pit of lava.

Comparisons Between the Game and the Movie:

This emasculation of the movie eliminates all of the comedic elements and turns the game into a straight action game with minor witty comments that appeared on the Super NES and the Sega Genesis versions of the game. Examples of these minor witty comments included statements like "you look great today" and "avoid fatty foods." Hardcore fans of the movie would eventually find out that the "talking computer" can only utter MDK repeatedly in the game. Even with this limitation in mind, the game can keep track of the players score and how many people he has killed. Due to the games Kids-to-Adults rating, there is no adult language as seen in the movie. When players see the machines that gave out fines for "violating the verbal morality stature" in the movie, they are considered to be mere decorations in the video game.

The first level is displayed in side view platform type, the health bar is displayed in the bottom left. John Spartan enters the stage by jumping with a cable from a helicopter, a scene taken from the movie

All references to Taco Bell have been eliminated because the Taco Bell restaurant is part of a side story involving Raymond Cocteau, Lenina Huxley, and John Spartan; it has nothing to do with the main quest of apprehending Simon Phoenix. The gunmen in the game are assumed to belong to Edgar Friendly; the movie mentions about a resistance army in the sewers rebelling against Raymond Cocteaus control of San Angeles. Simon Phoenix does not gather an army of his own until late in the movie and Edgar Friendly is the only one who has the charisma to recruit a mass number of gunmen from the start of the 2032 (future) segment of the film. There is also another stage that was never in the movie; the maglev train level. In this level, John Spartan must navigate through a futuristic train. He must try to avoid either getting killed by the thugs or the devices controlled by the trains central processing unit. The object of that level was to stop the train before it went uncontrollably fast. 

The futuristic parking lot level introduced a robotic villain that was never seen in the film; a renegade car crusher that attacked the player with automobiles.

Yeah, it a convoluted B-movie style plot, but when a game is this fun you tend to forgive the writers for not being H.G. Wells.

Doom makes the transition to the SNES without losing any of its atmosphere or fun in the process. The only thing that really disappointed me about this port was its lack of two-player, adversarial "Deathmatch," but even then, I still enjoy sitting back and tearing my way through the forces of Hell with nothing but a shotgun and my bare hands, and I have a feeling that you will too! The trademark MIDI soundtrack makes its way to the SNES intact, although the bass volume has been brought up in the mix this time around, which may or may not annoy you (I honestly didnt mind). Like the sound, the graphics are mostly intact, except for being slightly more choppy and blurry due to the SNES lower processing power, but even then, its not like youd notice that unless youve already played the PC version.

For my money, nothing beats Doom on the PC for classic shooting action, but this is still a great port to play if you cant get your hands on a copy, or just want to witness the evolution of one of gamings most celebrated franchises.

Directions:

Doom is essentially the archetype on which all other first person shooters are built. You go through various levels, killing zombies and monsters, starting with weapons like the pistol and shotgun, and gaining new weapons like the chaingun and plasma gun.

In order to exit the level, you must find the "EXIT" and flip the switch. There might also be doors, which require keycards to open. Keycards are scattered all over, and you must find them to open the desired door(s).

There are many power-ups throughout the game, such as "Berserk," which allows you to become invincible and kill any basic enemy in one or two hits with your fists. There are also various health packs and weapon power-ups strewn across the level, sometimes in out of the way places, that are essential to your survival when youll face off against the games bosses.

The bosses in Doom are an entirely different beast than the rest of the monsters in the game; you cant just yell "charge" and take them on at full force. Unless of course, you want to be completely and utterly annihilated. These fights are more cerebral, they require you to find a position and hunker down for a while until the monster has diverted his attention to something else (i.e. mindlessly wandering), then at that time you can proceed to blast him with your most powerful weapons. Youll find yourself repeating this process time and time again on some of the more powerful bosses throughout the game.

Random Weapons Bug
Immediately after picking up a chainsaw, switch to a weapon that you have no ammo for and try to fire it. When the empty weapon is used it will turn into another random weapon, which may be one you havent found yet. As they say in the industry, this is a bug, not a feature, so it doesnt always work the same way.

A Link to the Past really did clear the way for all other Zelda games. If havent tried this one, get on it right now.

Directions:

Collect all three pendants and all seven crystals to save Hyrule and Princess Zelda from the evil Ganon. 

This was the first Zelda game to have mini games that you could win prizes for. Well, thats if you dont count the money making game from the first one. A lot of the later Zelda games included bow shooting galleries where you could win a bigger quiver or a lot of money. This was also the first time Link had the option to pull something or push, instead of being able to push only. This was also the first one where he could pick random objects up or cut them up in order to find hidden goodies.

An incredibly popular game when it was first released, Space Invaders has inspired many reproductions over the years, although this type of game has been eclipsed by modern graphics-heavy, music-laden games.

In any case, the subtitle, "The Original Game," is pretty much the truth. The graphics are almost identical to the original Atari release. There is almost no animation, things just move back and forth on the screen. There is no background music, also true to the original, but the original sound effects are there, and still amazingly good for such a simple game.

The main difference is that this new edition has a competitive two-player mode. Not only can you take turns and compete for points, but you can face-off in a side-by-side split screen contest, in the tradition of Tetris and Dr. Mario.

If you like a game of survival and high scores, and if you like direct competition outside of the fighting game genre, then give Space Invaders a try. Youll love it!
