<Description>Blackthorne is an action-adventure game that takes place on the planet Tuul.

Tuul was a peaceful place, until the evil warrior Sarlac used the power of the Darkstone to take control. Blackthorne&apos;s father, the good King Vlaros, sent him to Earth just as his kingdom crumbled around him.
Now, 20 years later, Blackthorne is grown and must return to Tuul to free it from the clutches of Sarlac.

This game is played from a side-view with non-scrolling backgrounds. It has strong similarities to Prince of Persia, except you battle your foes using guns and bombs instead of a sword.</Description>

<Description>Cosmic Carnage is a one-on-one fighting game set in outer space.

The story begins as a prison barge is hijacked by it&apos;s cargo in an escape attempt. The resulting chaos caused the barge to crash into a military cruiser. The impact caused extensive damage to both ships. There were only 8 survivors, 4 from each ship. What&apos;s worse, there&apos;s only one escape pod.

You control one of the 8 survivors, and have to finish off all the others to escape with your life.

The gameplay in Cosmic carnage is similar to Street Fighter 2, but with a much slower pace. Some of the fighters can be customized with different armor combinations, allowing them access to different special moves.</Description>

<Description>(Text based on PC version)

The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars&apos; moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes.

A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.

id Software&apos;s follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine&apos;s perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself.
Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level. 
The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.

DOOM&apos;s engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein&apos;s, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein&apos;s orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.

Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.

DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.

DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein&apos;s arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still available. 
Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place.
Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried,
a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas),
light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and,
radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage.

Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.

The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons.

Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures.

DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect &apos;frag&apos; points for a kill and re-spawn in a random location after being killed.</Description>

<Description>Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims.
Firstly, the game&apos;s commentary was revolutionary at the time - the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied.
The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles.

FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it&apos;s possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you&apos;re not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</Description>

<Description>Knuckles Chaotix is a spin-off of the Sonic the Hedgehog series of Genesis games.

The starring character in this title is Knuckles the Echidna, who first appeared in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.
Knuckles works at Carnival Island, an amusement park. It&apos;s his job to protect the park and make it a happy place for visitors. Dr. Robotnik, as usual, has an evil plan for the park. He wants the power emerald which supplies electricity to the entire island. What&apos;s worse, he has imprisoned several of Knuckles&apos; friends in the &quot;combi confiner.&quot;  This contraption only allows Knuckles to free one of his friends at a time by attaching a tether between himself and them. Therefore, when you play the game you are always attached to another character.

Although the basic gameplay of Knuckles Chaotix is similar to the Sonic games, the bungee cord between the two characters creates new challenges.
The new characters that appear are Vector the Crocodile, Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon and Charmy Bee. There also two characters whose sole purpose is to slow you down, Heavy the Robot, and Bomb.

Chaotix adds several new power-ups and 3D bonus levels as well.</Description>

<Description>It&apos;s 5 years after the formation of the Worldwide Federation. Although war has been averted, terrorist cells around the world threaten the stability of the federation. To combat this menace, the Federation has created a bi-pedal armored tank known as the Metal Head.

You are a Metal Head pilot, and you have to use all the weapons at your disposal to take out the terrorists.

Metal Head is a bit of a variation on the usual giant robot combat game. The game&apos;s mission areas bear more resemblance to a first-person shooter than a simulation. The graphics are all rendered in texture mapped polygons, which is unusual for a 32X game.</Description>

<Description>The Mortal Kombat fighters, plus several new ones, return for a tournament held by the evil Shang Tsung of the Oddworld.
The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Sheng Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.</Description>

<Description>Motocross Championship is the only dirtbike racing game for the 32X.

The action takes place from a behind-the-bike perspective, and makes use of the 32X&apos;s hardware bitmap scaling to present a 3D graphical effect. Like the title suggests, the main game mode is a points based championship. You can compete in one of 3 motorcycle classes over 12 indoor and outdoor tracks.  
There&apos;s also two player split screen mode so you can share off-road fun with a friend.</Description>

<Description>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams.

Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with special moves including SuperJam power-ups, wild celebrations and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated out of ten on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks to dunks and 3-pointers.

Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for other players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.

This tournament version of the game adds an extra mode in which you have to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Once you have completed this, a higher CPU difficulty level is revealed.</Description>

<Description>RBI Baseball was licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) and used actual MLB player names, unlike other baseball video games of the late 1980s. It was not licensed by Major League Baseball (MLB) itself, however, and thus did not use team nicknames or logos. Instead, the game contained 8 teams listed only by city name: Boston, California, Detroit, Houston, Minnesota, New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco; their real-life, MLB counterparts were the playoff teams in the 1986 (Boston, California, Houston, New York) and 1987 (Detroit, Minnesota, St. Louis, San Francisco) MLB seasons. The game also boasted two All-Star teams, American League and National League; the two featured established veterans such as George Brett, Dale Murphy and Andre Dawson—none of whom appeared on the other eight teams—and up-and-coming players like Mark McGwire, Andrés Galarraga and José Canseco.

Each player has different capabilities in the game; hitters vary in ability to make solid contact, to hit the ball with power, and their base running speed. Vince Coleman is the fastest player in the game; it is very difficult to catch him stealing second base. Pitchers vary in pitching speed, and the amount by which the player can steer the ball left and right during its flight. Pitchers also have varying stamina; as a pitcher gets tired, the ball slows down and is harder to steer. Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens are by far two of the best pitchers in the game. There is no evidence that fielding abilities correspond to individual players.

The abilities of each player do not necessary correspond with the statistics shown on the screen when the player comes to bat or takes the mound. These statistics are generally accurate, with many exceptions (see below). They do not change during the course of the game or sequence of games.

A rudimentary box score is displayed during and after the game showing composite statistics for each team. A hit batter is credited with a walk, and anyone reaching on an error gets credited for a hit even as the other team is charged with an error. Conversely, a batter thrown out while trying for extra bases is not credited with a hit.

The rosters for the 8 teams are fairly accurate if simplified representations of the playoff rosters from their respective years. Each team has 8 starting batters, four bench players, two starting pitchers and two relievers. The player can start any pitcher they like, though the relievers have very low stamina. But if they play consecutive games without resetting the system, any starting pitcher used in the previous game will be unavailable. The player has to wait until the game starts before substituting players with pinch hitters, who can play any position.

In Vs. RBI Baseball, the teams are made up of legends from 10 different franchises. These players were statistically represented with their best seasons. A notable exception was that of McGwire, who was included on the Oakland team, and was statistically represented by his potential numbers. In a remarkable display of foresight, he was projected to hit 62 home runs in his best season. In 1998, he set the major league record for home runs in a season with 70.</Description>

<Description>Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire (Sangokushi IV in Japan) is the fourth game in Koei&apos;s Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. Wall of Fire was the last in the series to be released on PC in the U.S. until Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI.

In this update, ships can make other ships catch on fire. As well, archers can also fire flaming arrows at other soldiers and catapults. The graphics are enhanced and there are more things to do within the bounds of ancient China herself. The player can even summon barbarians to do raids on enemy territory. There are 4 different scenarios, and the ultimate goal is complete reunification of China. Alliances and friendships can hold back the tide of war and invasion but in the end, the player only holds allegiance to himself.

Such betrayal of a ruler&apos;s allies will be witnessed often as the AI is not geared towards long-term friendship, and eventually its need to conquer China before the human player will override its need for partnership and multilateralism. In this pre-modern time, not only is unilateralism accepted, it is expected for most rulers in the 3rd century to have their nations be militarily superior to other nations in case of war or civil disorder.</Description>

You control a space fighter in a series of battles against huge enemy ships. There are 2 different types of ships to fly, and 6 different missions. In most missions, you have to destroy several locations on a large ship in order to blow up the whole thing. There are two ways to play the game.  First, you can directly control the ship and maneuver it around the 3D polygon environments. Second, you can let the 32X do the flying, and simply control a gun turret.</Description>

<Description>Space Harrier is set in &quot;the Fantasy Zone&quot;, a surreal world composed of bright colors and a checkerboard-styled ground. The enemies are also unique, featuring prehistoric animals, Chinese dragons, and alien pods. The player is forced along the levels, running or flying around enemy fire, while shooting back with fireballs via the character&apos;s under-arm cannon (which doubles as a rocket-esque device allowing the character to fly). The character graphics are sprite-based, though the level backgrounds are faux 3D. The 3-D Battles of World Runner by Square bears more than a slight resemblance to the game. Even more similar is Pony Canyon&apos;s parody, Animal Attack Academy in which a Japanese schoolgirl fights Australian animals in nearly identical gameplay. The arcade version of Space Harrier used digitized voices. When starting the first level, for example, you would be greeted with &quot;Welcome to the fantasy zone!; get ready!&quot;. After defeating a boss, the player is assured that &quot;You&apos;re doing great!&quot;

Like After Burner, Space Harrier was among the first (perhaps the very first) arcade game to feature a console in which the player sits, and which moves according to the joystick movement. There is also a non-moving sit-down version and a standard upright version.

The arcade version has a total of 18 levels, each containing a boss at the end. Three exceptions are the bonus levels (5th and 12th), and the 18th level, which is a boss rush containing all bosses encountered up to that point.

The game was translated to various home computer systems and consoles. Among these, the ports for the Sega 32X, the Sega Saturn and the Sharp X68000 (the latter being a Japan-only) are considered to be the most faithful to the original arcade version.</Description>

This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret &quot;Hit Man&quot; Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.

Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter.

Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.</Description>

<Description>This 32X-exclusive sci-fi shooter has gameplay is somewhat like Sega arcade classic Zaxxon.

The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment. The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons.

Although the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without getting shot, the game has a strategic element. Your basic spacecraft has very little firepower, and can only sustain one hit. To make matters worse, there are very few power-ups. In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies and take control of their weapons systems. This system allows for a large variety of player-controllable ships. </Description>
