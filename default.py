# I have built this script from scratch but you will find some lines or ideas that are taken 
# from other xbmc scripts. Some basic ideas are taken from Redsandros "Arcade Browser" and I often 
# had a look at Nuka1195's "Apple Movie Trailers" script while implementing this one. Thanks for your work!
